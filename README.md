## Project Description

In the project, I created a Complete Todo Application with all features. I'm happy to share that I've completed all the CRUD operations for our project. To build the user interface, I used `React.js`, and for state management, I employed `Redux`. Exploring the realm of basic animations, I integrated `Framer Motion` into our app. Since I aimed to make it beginner-friendly, I hope you'll find it enjoyable and informative. It was a great experience putting it all together!
